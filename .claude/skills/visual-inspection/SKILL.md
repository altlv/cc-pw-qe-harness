description: Look at a rendered page methodically — the pre-flight checks that find bugs in the first two minutes, a sweep across positions and states, and the conditions worth forcing. Use before or during any session against a UI, and whenever a defect is likely to be visible rather than queryable. Not for deciding what to test (test-design) or for choosing input values (test-techniques).
---

A DOM query answers what the page contains. It cannot tell you the panel escapes its
container, that two things overlap, that a word has a hole in the middle, or that a
spinner never stops.

This skill exists because "look at the page" is not a method. Told to look, an agent
looks **once**, at **one viewport**, in **one state**, and reports what it happens to
see. Three separate defects were missed that way in this repo's own sessions — all of
them plainly visible in a screenshot taken two scrolls further down.

## When to use

- Before a charter, as pre-flight — the first two minutes are the cheapest bugs you
  will ever collect
- Whenever the product renders something for a person to look at
- After any change to layout, copy, or an async region

## When NOT to use

- Deciding what deserves coverage → `test-design`
- Choosing which values to enter → `test-techniques`
- Judging whether what you saw is wrong → `oracle-check`

## Operating rules

- **A screenshot is a sample, not a survey.** One image is one position, one state,
  one viewport. Say which one.
- **Notice, then measure.** The eye finds it; a measurement makes it arguable. "That
  row looks off" becomes "this tile renders 376x346 where the other fifteen render
  376x376" — the second gets fixed.
- **Occlusion is directional.** _A covers B_ and _B covers A_ are two defects. Finding
  one does not clear the other, and in this repo's own session the second was missed
  after the first was found.

## 1. Pre-flight — five checks, under two minutes

Do these before the charter. They are not exploration; they are the bugs lying in the
open. Every one of them found a real defect in this repo's sessions.

**Do the arithmetic.** Any page showing numbers that should relate. Subtotal +
shipping + tax − discount against the total. Line total against quantity × price.
Item count against items shown. One subtraction found a cart adding a phantom $100 to
every order.

**Read every literal string.** Read, not skim. Placeholders shipped to production,
unhandled states, and broken grammar all surface in the same pass — "Loading Title",
"Test Title", "Missing Option:", a gift-card field pre-filled `...test...`, a button
reading `RETURN TO STOR   E`, an error saying "could not completed".

Then `Ctrl+F` for: `lorem` · `test` · `todo` · `TBD` · `placeholder` · `undefined` ·
`null` · `NaN` · `[object`.

**Open the console and network panel before touching anything.** A dead CDN and a
`404 /undefined` on every page load, found before the first click.

**Tab through it.** Ten seconds of pressing Tab. A page with 72 controls and 5 tab
stops is a finding. So is focus order that does not match reading order, a trap, and a
control that never receives focus at all.

**Say the same fact twice.** Any value shown in two places is a free oracle — a price
in the listing, on the detail page, in the cart, in the structured data. A product
refusing to show a price while sorting into its correct position by that price is how
you learn the price exists.

## 2. The sweep — position × state

The failure this prevents is looking once. Walk both axes.

**Positions:** top · middle · **bottom**. The footer is a place you go, not somewhere
you end up. Two defects in this repo's sessions lived there.

**States:** default · an overlay or panel open · with data · with none · mid-load ·
after an error · signed in.

The interesting cells are the combinations: _bottom of the page, with the login panel
open_ is a state nothing visits by accident, and it is where a panel was found sitting
on top of the legal links.

### Transient surfaces — the ones no page scan visits

A mini-cart, dropdown, modal, toast, drawer, tooltip or popover is a **surface**, not a
page. It exists only in a state, so it appears in no inventory and no crawl. Open each
one and look at it _in place_, at the position it appears.

A cart-preview panel hanging off the bottom of the page was missed for exactly this
reason: the cart _page_ was tested thoroughly and the cart _preview_ was never opened.

### What to look for

| Look for                        | Reads as                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alignment across a repeated row | one tile shorter than its siblings; a button 30px above its neighbours |
| Containment                     | content escaping its box, a panel past the page edge, overlap          |
| Occlusion, **both ways**        | a banner over a control; a panel over the footer                       |
| Broken text                     | a gap inside a word, truncation, overflow, a space before a full stop  |
| Repetition                      | the same breadcrumb, heading or block rendered twice                   |
| Label against content           | an image that does not match its title; "Select Shirt Size" on a coat  |
| Async regions                   | a spinner that never resolves; an empty state with no explanation      |

### Two free reveals

- **`Ctrl+A`** — select-all renders invisible text visible: duplicated content, strings
  parked off-screen, text outside its container.
- **Zoom to 50%** — nobody does this one. It exposes absolutely-positioned elements
  parked outside the viewport and containers that do not actually contain.

And **zoom to 200%**, which is a standard rather than a curiosity: content forced wider
than the viewport is a WCAG 1.4.10 failure.

## 3. Conditions worth forcing

Cheap, and each opens a class of state normal use never reaches.

| Force                                 | Exposes                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phone width                           | navigation that vanishes with no replacement                                       |
| Slow network, then offline mid-action | every loading and failure state you never see at full speed                        |
| Print preview                         | layouts that only exist on screen — receipts and confirmations most                |
| CSS disabled / reader mode            | DOM order against visual order; content that only works when styled                |
| One hostile paste per field           | a long string, an emoji, an RTL string, a leading space — one each, not a campaign |

---

## The placeholder rule

**A placeholder or loading string visible in production is evidence about a class, not
a typo.**

This is the rule that costs the most when it is missed. "Loading Title" rendered on a
live page was filed as a copy defect and moved past. It was pointing at a product whose
async states are unhandled — and the same defect family was later found as a billing
panel spinning forever behind a login. The string was a signpost, read as litter.

When you find one, stop and ask what it implies, then go looking for the rest of its
family.

## Decision points

| Situation                             | Action                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It looks wrong but you cannot say why | Measure it. A number turns an impression into a defect report.                   |
| It only reproduces at one size        | Say which. A viewport-specific defect is still a defect                          |
| Something is ugly but works           | `oracle-check` — is there an oracle, or is it taste? Raise taste as a question   |
| You found one occlusion               | Look for the reverse before moving on                                            |
| A spinner has not resolved            | Wait longer, then say how long you waited. "Slow" and "never" are different bugs |

## Interlaying (blind spot)

This finds what is visible. It says nothing about whether the numbers behind the page
are right, whether a control does what it claims, or whether anything persisted —
`test-techniques` and `exploratory-session` cover those.

It also depends on being able to see. An agent with no screenshot tool cannot run this
skill at all, and should say so rather than substituting a DOM query and calling it
looking.
